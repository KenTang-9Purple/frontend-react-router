The Three-Step Frontend React Transformation 

In this trilogy of evolution, I have delved into the technology and processes of website development, continuously optimizing and splitting components to enhance development efficiency, application performance, and uniformity.

In https://github.com/KenTang-9Purple/frontend / https://kentang-9purple.github.io/frontend/ , I created a website using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript that adheres to responsive design, user experience, and accessibility standards. We introduced a hamburger menu to conceal multiple functionalities and used JavaScript's Date Object to dynamically update the year on the webpage.

In https://github.com/KenTang-9Purple/frontend-react / https://kentang-9purple.github.io/frontend-react/, I decomposed the initial version into distinct JSX components such as Nav, Hero, About, Values, Pillars, and Footer. By leveraging data imports, we achieved dynamic content generation, significantly boosting development efficiency. With React's useState, we added a state variable to the hamburger menu for seamless toggling.

In https://github.com/KenTang-9Purple/frontend-react-router / https://kentang-9purple.github.io/frontend-react-router/ , we implemented a routing solution using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route, ensuring synchronization between UI and URLs to enable a multi-page application. We segmented the website into five pages, sharing a unified navigation and footer component. Through data imports and filtering, we customized content for multiple pages, further enhancing development efficiency and uniformity.

This evolutionary journey not only enhances the attractiveness of the website but also improves user experience and development efficiency, injecting more functionality into website.

前端React化三步曲

在這三步曲的進化中，我探索了網站開發的技術與流程，並通過不斷優化和拆分，提升了開發效率、應用性能和統一性。

在 https://github.com/KenTang-9Purple/frontend / https://kentang-9purple.github.io/frontend/ ，我運用 CSS、HTML 和 JavaScript 創造了一個符合響應式設計、使用者體驗和可訪問性標準的網站。我引入了漢堡菜單來隱藏多項功能，同時利用 JavaScript 的 Date Object 實時更新網頁年份。

在 https://github.com/KenTang-9Purple/frontend-react / https://kentang-9purple.github.io/frontend-react/ ，我將第一個版本分解成各個獨立的 JSX 元件，包括 Nav、Hero、About、Values、Pillars 和 Footer。通過數據導入，我們實現了動態生成內容，大幅提高了開發效率。使用 React 的 useState，我為漢堡菜單添加了狀態變數，使其能夠無縫切換。

在 https://github.com/KenTang-9Purple/frontend-react-router / https://kentang-9purple.github.io/frontend-react-router/ ，我採用 BrowserRouter、Routes 和 Route 實現了路由解決方案，使 UI 和 URL 保持同步，實現了多頁面應用程序。我將網站拆分成了五個頁面，共享了統一的導航和頁腳元件。通過數據導入和篩選，我實現了多個頁面的內容定制，進一步提高了開發效率和統一性。

這一演進過程不僅讓網站更具吸引力，同時也提升了使用者體驗和開發效率，為網站注入了更多功能。


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
